# Obtain the OTP release from an OTP source tree
#
# Sets the following environment variables:
#
#   otp_release
#       The full release string, which may be more verbose than what will
#       be returned by erlang:system_info(otp_release).
#
#   otp_vsn_major
#       The integer value of the release's major version. This value will
#       always be an integer greater than zero.
#
#   otp_vsn_minor
#       The integer value of the release's minor version. This value will
#       be zero if not explicitly included in the release information.
#
# On error, an error is printed, a non-zero result is returned, and the
# variables are not set.
